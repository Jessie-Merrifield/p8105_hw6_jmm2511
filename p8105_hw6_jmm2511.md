## Problem 2

Using Central Park weather data

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())
```

a simple linear regression with tmax as the response with tmin and prcp
as the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two
quantities estimated from these data:

r^2 log(β<sup>1∗β</sup>2)

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities.

``` r
q2_estimates = weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(5000, id = "strap_number") %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data=.x)),
    tidy_results = map(models, broom::tidy),
    glance_results = map(models, broom::glance)
  ) %>% 
  select(strap_number, tidy_results, glance_results) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_results, glance_results) %>% 
  group_by(strap_number) %>% 
  summarise(log_product = log(estimate[term == "tmin"] * estimate[term == "prcp"]),
            r_squared=r.squared)%>%
  filter(!is.nan(log_product), !is.nan(r_squared))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'strap_number'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
#removed NaN values
```

Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words.

``` r
q2_plot_r2 <- q2_estimates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=r_squared))+
  geom_density()

q2_plot_r2
```

``` r
q2_plot_r2 <- q2_estimates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log_product))+
  geom_density()

q2_plot_r2
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_jmm2511_files/figure-gfm/plot log-1.png" width="90%" />

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and
log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1)

``` r
log_product_quantiles <- quantile(q2_estimates$log_product, c(0.025, 0.975))
#had to do it this way because I had previously grouped by strap_number

log_product_quantiles
```

    ##      2.5%     97.5% 
    ## -9.108701 -4.572475

``` r
r2_quantiles <- quantile(q2_estimates$r_squared, c(0.025, 0.975))

r2_quantiles
```

    ##      2.5%     97.5% 
    ## 0.8829912 0.9258560

. Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing log(β<sup>1∗β</sup>2)

## Problem 3

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight.

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
birthweight<-read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only)

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these Make this comparison
in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and
functions in purrr as appropriate.
