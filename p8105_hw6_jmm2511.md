## Problem 2

Using Central Park weather data

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())
```

a simple linear regression with tmax as the response with tmin and prcp
as the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two
quantities estimated from these data:

r^2 log(β<sup>1∗β</sup>2)

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities.

Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words.

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and
log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1)

. Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing log(β<sup>1∗β</sup>2)

## Problem 3

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight.

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
birthweight<-read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only)

One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
(including the three-way interaction) between these Make this comparison
in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and
functions in purrr as appropriate.
